    <H2 style="font-style: initial; color: black;">Inside the modern-day plantation: How theater confronts incarceration
    </H2> <br>
    <h3>attling the Bars host Mansa Musa explores how a one-woman play, The Peculiar Patriot, reveals the human cost of
        mass incarceration and the enduring ties between slavery and the prison system. The artist behind the play, Liza
        Jessie Peterson, has worked with incarcerated youth for decades, bringing their stories to the stage and to
        national audiences. Performed in more than 35 US prisons and filmed at Louisiana’s Angola Prison—once a
        plantation, now a maximum-security facility—the play became the basis of the documentary, Angola: Do You Hear
        Us? (Paramount Plus / Amazon Prime). As the fight for abolition and prison reform gains momentum, this story
        reminds us that art is not decoration—it’s a tool for awakening, organizing, and freedom.</h3> <br>

    <h2 style="font-style: oblique; color: black;font-size: ;">Bumrah
        Imaginary IPL auction prediction: Who among Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Jasprit Bumrah will get highest price?
        Mohammad Kaif answers</h2> <br>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic;color: black;">Well, although it is an imaginary scenario, it is an interesting debate
        among IPL fans about which superstar will fetch a higher price than what they are earning currently with their
        franchise. Discussing Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Jasprit Bumrah, Kaif answered who among the three will
        fetch the maximum price if they were to be released in a hypothetical auction.

        “Among the three, Jasprit Bumrah would get the most money. Bumrah will get a lot of money because a bowler like
        Bumrah comes once in a generation. The kind of work he does for his team is exceptional. Virat the batter, maybe
        you can find others like him, but Virat the brand, that continues. Nowadays, Virat the brand carries immense
        value,” Kaif said.

        “See, whichever franchise joins the IPL or buys a team, they come to do business. They have invested money, so
        they want to earn money. It’s simple. They haven’t come here to do anyone a favor or to groom players; all that
        is nonsense. They are here to do business,” he added.

        “So, Virat the brand has huge value because of that, and that’s why franchises want him. Their people would love
        to have Kohli with them. But if you ask who the biggest match-winner is among them, I would put Bumrah far ahead
        of Virat,” Kaif added
