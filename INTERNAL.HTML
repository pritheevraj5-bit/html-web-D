    <h1> ABOUT DJANGO</h1>
    <p>Django (often misspelled as "djnango"), <br> a very popular and powerful web framework written in the Python programming language. Django's main purpose is to make it <br> easier and faster for developers to build complex, secure, and database-driven websites. It follows a "batteries-included" philosophy, meaning it comes with a vast array of built-in tools <br> and features right out of the box, such as an object-relational mapper (ORM) for interacting with databases,  <br>an automatic admin interface, and robust security features to protect against common web vulnerabilities. By emphasizing reusable components and the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, Django helps developers write clean, <br> maintainable code and take projects from concept to completion very quickly.</p>
