    <p>🚀 Django is a **free and open-source web framework** written in **Python**.

It's designed to help developers build **complex, database-driven websites** quickly and efficiently. It follows the "batteries included" philosophy, meaning it provides a comprehensive set of built-in components and tools for common web development tasks, allowing you to focus on the unique aspects of your application.

## Key Features & Principles

* **Python-Based:** Because it's written in Python, it benefits from the language's readability, large community, and extensive libraries.
* **Rapid Development:** Django encourages quick development by handling much of the repetitive groundwork of web development.
* **"Batteries Included":** It comes with many features right out of the box, including:
    * **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):** A system that allows you to interact with your database using Python objects (classes) instead of writing raw SQL.
    * **Automatic Admin Interface:** It can automatically generate a professional, production-ready administrative site based on your data models.
    * **Authentication System:** Robust user management, including login, logout, password hashing, and permissions.
    * **URL Routing, Templating System, and Form Handling.**
* **Security:** Django helps developers avoid many common security mistakes by providing built-in protection against threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
* **DRY Principle:** It promotes the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle to reduce code redundancy and make development more efficient and maintainable.

## Architectural Pattern: MTV

Django uses the **Model-Template-View (MTV)** architectural pattern, which is a variation of the common Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern:

* **Model:** This is the **data structure** and how it interacts with the database (handled by Django's ORM).
* **Template:** This is the **presentation layer**—the HTML, CSS, and front-end code that the user sees.
* **View:** This contains the **business logic** that receives the web request, retrieves data from the Model, and passes it to the Template to render the final response.

<b>Django is used by many major organizations and is highly scalable, used for sites like Instagram, Mozilla, and National Geographic.
